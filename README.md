# 8085-Simulator

Hi,
Thank you for visiting.

In this project I am trying to develop a simulation for 8085 microprocessor. The main goal behind this project is to learn the concepts of virtualization.

About 8085 microprocessor:
It was produced by intel in March 1976. 8085 was an improved version of the 8080 with some additional features and enhancements. In early-to-mid-1980s it was quite popular as it was used in a variety of applications, including personal computers, industrial control systems, and scientific instruments. It was also used in many early arcade video games, such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man. Due to it's high success along with it's predecessory 8080, it is considered as a milestone in microprocessors. It is still used by hobist and students for learning purposes.

The 8085 microprocessor has six general-purpose registers, including B, C, D, E, H, and L.
Stack Pointer and Instruction Pointer.
The flags register is an 8-bit register that contains status flags that indicate the result of an arithmetic or logical operation. These flags include the carry flag, zero flag, sign flag, and parity flag.
It can support 64KB of memory.

So far I've managed to implement the registers, couple of flags, and memory.

Right now it can execute simple machine code.

Feel free to Raise any issues, Submit Pull Requests with a bug fix and/or improvement, or even for any suggestions and/or feedback/

Future Developement:
1. Memmory handling and management.
2. Adding remaining instruction sets.
3. Add remaining flags.
4. Add a in-built compilar which can accept assembly program and run on the simulator.
5. Add IO along with it's environment.
6. Add GUI.
